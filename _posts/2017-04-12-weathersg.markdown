[data.gov.sg]() provides weather information in Singapore from 2017 at an interval of 5 minutes or 1 hour. The dataset can be downloaded through API, but downloading data of one day or longer almost always fails. Therefore, I downloaded weather related datasets and uploaded to [github](https://github.com/wanglongqi/SG-Weather). Enjoy!
