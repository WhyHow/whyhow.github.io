I am very happy to announce the version 1.00 of WriteTeX. As is discussed in the previous post, this plugin will release its final version when the pdf cropping problem is solved. And now, I am very glad to say that the crop function is introduced into the plugin, and it will be enabled automatically if `pdfcrop` command is available in the running environment. And thus, here is the 1.00 version of the plugin, and this is also the final version of it.

At this moment I would like to say that the main workflow of this plugin is fixed. It is unlikely the procedure of the plugin will be changed dramatically in the future. The main functions of the plugin are also quite steady for years. Considering this PDF import issue has been discussed for years, it is possible in the next release of Inkscape, the function of the plugin can be fully implemented into the main program. Then, there is no meaning to keep this plugin running. No matter what, I think this is a good time to release this final version of the plugin.

Do not worry, there may be some minor bug fixes for this plugin. However, in general, I would like to say this is the end of this plugin.

我非常高兴地宣布WriteTeX的最终版发布了。正如先前的文章提到的，再解决PDF裁剪的问题之后，这个插件将发布最终版。而现在我荣幸地说，这个问题已经解决了。如果`pdfcrop`存在于运行环境当中，那么插件将自动调用裁剪功能。

在此时，我想说这个插件的流程不大可能再做变更，而且这个插件的功能也已经稳定了数年。同时考虑到，这个PDF文件导入的问题已经讨论多年，有可能在下一版Inkscape中可能引入完整的解决方案。因此，也没有理由继续维护这个插件。不管怎么说，这都是一个合适的终止该项目的时间。

不用担心，一些小的BUG修正还是会有的。不过，基本上这就是这个插件的最后一个版本了，我不想再在RC上停留数月。
